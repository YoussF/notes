# AWS reStart - Cloud Practitioner Exam Preparation

## **Introduction to Cloud Foundations**

### **Basic computing**

Key takeaways:

- A server is a computer that provides data or services to other computers.
- A data center is a physical location where an organization stores and operates its computer and networking equipment.
- Hardware virtualization enables you to create VMs on a physical computer. It’s a fundamental technology that’s used in cloud computing.
- The phases of the Software Development Life Cycle are:
  - Plan
  - Analyze
  - Design
  - Develop
  - Test
  - Implement
  - Maintain

### **Development Team Roles**

- The roles involved in the development of software include:
  - Project manager
  - Analyst
  - Quality assurance
  - Software developer
  - Database administrator
- Effective practices for developing software in a team include(s):
  - Clearly defining and communicating the requirements
  - Documenting the design
  - Using version control

### **What is Cloud Computing**

Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of compute power, database, storage, applications, and other IT resources. These resources are delivered through a cloud services platform via the internet, with pay-as-you-go pricing.

The cloud comprises server computers in large data centers in different locations around the world. When you use a cloud service like Amazon Web Services (AWS), you use the computers that AWS owns.

The computers contain various technology features and services, which are like building blocks that can be used to assemble solutions. These solutions help users meet their business goals and technology requirements. With cloud computing, organizations can consume on-demand computing and storage resources instead of building, operating, and improving infrastructure on their own

**Traditional Computing Model (requirements/cons):**

    - Space
    - Staff
    - Physical security
    - Planning
    - Capital expenditure.
    - You must provide capacity that’s based on guessing theoretical maximum peaks
    - if your needs change? (new resources) You must go through the time, effort, and cost that’s needed to handle these changes.

**Cloud Computing Model**

Cloud computing enables you to stop thinking of your infrastructure as hardware, and instead think of it (and use it) as software.

You can provision and terminate resources as necessary on AWS, instead of paying for hardware when you are not using it. You can treat resources as temporary and disposable, free from the inflexibility and constraints of a fixed and finite IT infrastructure.

By harnessing the power of AWS, you can be more agile and efficient with change management, testing, reliability, and capacity planning.

**Cloud Service Model**

- On-Premises:

  You manage everything.

- Infrastructure as a service (IaaS):

  You manage the server, which can be physical or virtual, and the operating system (Microsoft Windows or Linux). In general, the data center provider has no access to your server.

- Platform as a service (PaaS):

  Someone else manages the underlying hardware and operating systems. In this way, you can run applications without managing underlying infrastructure (for example, patching, updates, maintenance, hardware, and operating systems). PaaS also provides a framework for developers that they can build on to create customized applications.

- Software as a service (SaaS):

  You manage your files while the service provider manages all data centers, servers, networks, storage, maintenance, and patching. You handle only the software and how you want to use it. You are provided with a complete product that the service provider runs and manages. Facebook and Dropbox are examples of SaaS. You manage your Facebook contacts and Dropbox files, and the service providers manage the systems.

**Cloud Deployment Model**

- **Cloud** is a cloud-based application that is fully deployed in the cloud. All parts of the application run in the cloud.
- **Hybrid** is a way to connect infrastructure and applications between cloud-based resources and existing resources that are not in the cloud. The most common method of hybrid deployment is between the cloud and existing on-premises infrastructure
- **On-premises** is when you run a cloud infrastructure from your own data center. Although this kind of deployment lacks many of the benefits of cloud computing, it does provide dedicated resources. It’s a popular choice for organizations that must meet certain compliance standards.

**You can use cloud computing platform for :**

- Application hosting for an on-demand infrastructure that hosts internal or SaaS applications
- Backup and storage capability to store data and build dependable backup solutions
- Content delivery to distribute content worldwide, with high data transfer speeds
- Hosting static and dynamic websites
- Enterprise IT to host internal-facing or external-facing IT applications in the AWS Cloud
- Various scalable database solutions, from hosted enterprise database software to non-relational database solutions

**Key takeaways :**

- Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources via the internet, with pay-as-you-go pricing
- Cloud computing enables you to think of (and use) your infrastructure as software
- The three cloud service models are IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS
- The three cloud deployment models are cloud, hybrid, and private (or on-premises) cloud
- Many AWS service analogs are available for the traditional, on-premises IT space

### **Cloud Roles**

### **Advantages of Cloud Computing**

- Trade capital expense (capex) for variable expense
- Benefit from massive economies of scale
- Reduce guessing about capacity
- Increase speed and agility
- Stop spending money on running and maintaining data centers
- Go global in minutes
